A simple list, in no particular order of issues and
bugs that were found when playing with the program.


1)
	Option 7 in userMain searches the user list 
	via. user id or user name. It is able to 
	search the list backward by user id,
	for example user id 1 will set the current
	node to head, but it will not forward search
	the list.


2)
	Option 4 in usermain (delete) will delete
	the node, however when you request to
	display the deleted user (option 5) the
	program segfaults.

3)	
	Node pid are not setting properly. These are
	supposed to be parrent ids, however they are
	setting more like uid. (which might be an
	intersting addition eventually.)

4)
	When attempting to make a new status in any user
	an error message is shown saying pro1vided status
	node is not free, Even when the user has just
	been created.

5)
	Creating instance's of status's in general causes
	a segfault.

6)
	Add Delete status's
	and Evetually add delete instances of status's.

7)
