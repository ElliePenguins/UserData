A simple list, in no particular order of issues and
bugs that were found when playing with the program.


1)
	Option 7 in userMain searches the user list 
	via. user id or user name. It is able to 
	search the list backward by user id,
	for example user id 1 will set the current
	node to head, but it will not forward search
	the list.

2)
	Option 4 in usermain (delete) will delete
	the node, however when you request to
	display the deleted user (option 5) the
	program segfaults.

3)	
	Node id's are not setting properly. pid's are
	supposed to be parent id's, however they are
	setting more like uid. (which might be an
	intersting addition eventually.)
	
	also id's need to be set 0 (head) to  n (tail)
	not a unique id for every entity accross multiple
	users. pid can be changed to uid; id is used for 
	quickly searching the list, and needs to be fixed. 
 
5)
	Instance need to have an output option in the
	test program "userMain."

6)
	Add Delete status's
	and Evetually add delete instances of status's.

	* Need a delete everything method to clean up
	  on program shutdown.
	
7)
	Don't allow creating nodes on the HEAD node.
		- Or should this be left up to 
		  the developer using the lib.
		- Either way it segfaults.

8)	Hashes are still just hardcoded values, add 
	hashing library.

9)	add display instance to userMain.c for testing.
